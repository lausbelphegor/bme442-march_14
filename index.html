					<h2>Prion Disease</h2>
					<p>Prion diseases are a group of rare, transmissible, untreatable, and fatal brain diseases that affect mammals. They are caused by abnormally folded proteins called prions.</p>
					<aside class="notes">Their cause is highly unusual: The host's normal prion protein can, for unknown reasons, malfunction and assemble into structured aggregates called prions that cause infectious brain disease</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Study Aim</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">To develop an AI-based framework for the accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) as positive or negative for prion disease</li>
						<li class="fragment">To quantify prion proteins distribution across tissue sections</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">The primary goal of the study is to leverage AI to improve the diagnostic process for prion diseases, potentially extending this methodology to other neurodegenerative disorders.</aside>

						<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Slides were obtained from Piedmont Reference Center for Diagnosis and Monitoring of Prion Diseases (DOMP) ( 2002 - 2008 )</p>

						<h2>Feature Extraction & Machine Learning Methods</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Texture Analysis</li>
							<li>Use of UPerNet for multi-scale feature extraction combined with the TWINS architecture</li>
							<li>Classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="container">
							<img class="col" src=".\public\images\rgb-grayscale-deltae.png" alt="RGB, Grayscale, and DeltaE images comparison" >

						<aside class="notes">
						  This slide presents the initial step in feature extraction, displaying RGB, Grayscale, and DeltaE images. Notably, the DeltaE image is advantageous because it accentuates the red staining of prion proteins, which is crucial for identifying the presence of prions in the tissue samples.

						<h2>Texture Analysis</h2>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>DeltaE</h2>
						<div class="container">
							<img src=".\public\images\deltae.png" alt="DeltaE image" height="500" width="500">
							<ul>

								<li class="fragment">DeltaE represents the difference between two colors</li>
								<li class="fragment">Useful for emphasizing the differences in staining</li>
								
							</ul>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						  This slide explains the L,a,b color space, which is crucial for the DeltaE calculation. DeltaE represents the difference between two colors, which is particularly useful in this study for emphasizing the differences in staining, a critical factor for identifying prion protein aggregates.

					<aside class="notes">We implemented sophisticated feature extraction, utilizing texture analysis and advanced architectures like UPerNet and TWINS for deep learning. This facilitated the use of traditional machine learning classifiers and deep neural networks to analyze the images in detail.</aside>

					<h2>System Output</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Binary classification of WSIs as positive or negative for prion disease</li>
						<li>Detailed segmentation maps highlighting PrPSc aggregates</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">The output from our AI system includes a binary classification of disease presence and segmentation maps that provide insights into prion protein distribution within the tissue.</aside>
